#Basic Free Shipping Countdown

This code snippet can be used to quickly setup a simple free shipping countdown widget on an NS Storefront. 

###Usage

Simply copy the markup (from the file: freeshippingcountdown.html) and paste it in the location you wish the countdown to appear.

Be sure to customize the free shipping cutoff value (which is 100 by default). You can do this by simply changing that value in the 2 places it appears in the code: Line 7, Line 8.
